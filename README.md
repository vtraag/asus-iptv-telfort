This document describes the setup to use Routed IPTV for an Asus RT-AC68U, when using on Telfort TV.
Note this is intended as a memory for my own purpose, so that it may not work as intended for your purpose.

First of all, make sure that the Settings in LAN > IPTV are as follows:

* Internet VID 34, PRIO 1
* LAN port 4, PRIO 5
* LAN port 3, PRIO 5

Also make sure that the IGMP Proxy and IGMP Snooping are both enabled.

The rest of the setup follows the instructions provided [here](https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/49094725#49094725).
